## Overview
This project focused on creating a model that could determine how much a student's freshman year at Birmingham-Southern College (BSC) affects their probabilty of finishing and graduating also at BSC. The project used data provided by the school from year 2014 to current, which we honed in on 2014-2018 to look at the freshmen and 2014 and follow them to graduation in 2018. This model could be useful for Birmingham-Southern College to increase the number of student's staying and graduating at the institution.
